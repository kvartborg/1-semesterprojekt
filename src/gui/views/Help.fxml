You have to complete your mission while,&#10;avoiding Trump at all costs. &#10;Trump is located in the “Oval Office” from the beginning. &#10;&#10;Controls:&#10;The arrow keys are used to move around the different rooms in the game, &#10;and have the corresponding directions (the arrow key “UP” = player goes up”).&#10;Other possibilities in the game are:&#10;(Button = Function)&#10;&#10;T = Talk&#10;“Talk” allows you to interact with a character.&#10;&#10;S = Search&#10;“Search” searches the current room for items and opens a window,&#10; where you can pick up items.&#10;&#10;I = Inventory&#10;“Inventory” opens the players inventory in a window&#10; and allows the player to use or drop items. &#10;&#10;C = Call&#10;“Call” is a method used to lure Trump in to a position using bait found in the game. &#10;&#10;W = Wait&#10;“Wait” is used to wait out a turn in the current position, whilst Trump takes a new position. &#10;&#10;Stuck?&#10;-&#9;If you’re stuck in the game, try using the different items and find their different uses. &#10;        However, be careful which items you use, as some of them have a less productive &#10;        outcome. &#10;-&#9;Listen to the hints you can find in conversations, and descriptions.
